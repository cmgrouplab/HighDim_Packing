Hi Yang,

Of course, happy to help.

I've attached a .zip containing the most recent version of TJ (as far as I'm aware). This is the version that I've been using on the della cluster with no modifications to what's going on under the hood. Adam Hopkins recommended I use the gurobi barrier method solver, which is what I used to produce my N = 20k configurations in 3D and is the default option selected in the sample_input_parameters.in file in the .zip.

Best,
Charles
